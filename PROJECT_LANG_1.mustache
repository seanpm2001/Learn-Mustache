{{About:}}
{{I decided to make Mustache the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Mustache) as Mustache is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Mustache programming language. It only makes sense to Mustache the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.}}
